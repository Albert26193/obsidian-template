# README

👋 Hey there, welcome to my Obsidian note repository! 📚

> This repository is a collection of my notes on various topics related to computer science and general knowledge about life. 💻🧠

I use Obsidian as my note-taking tool because it allows me to link ideas together and create a network of interconnected notes. 🌐

In this repository, you'll find my notes on topics like programming languages, data structures, algorithms, as well as notes on more practical topics like cooking, travel, and personal development. 🍳✈️🧘‍♀️

I hope you find my notes helpful and informative! Feel free to explore and let me know if you have any questions. 😊
